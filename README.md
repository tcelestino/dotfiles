# dotfiles

Hey! üëã

This repo stores my personal app configs and customizations. I mainly use zsh, but you can adapt for bash or other shells.
Since I work with macOS and Ubuntu, configs are optimized for these OSs. But no worries - you can easily tweak them for other systems too!

## Usage

This repo is 100% open for you to explore and customize. Just clone it and swap my configs with yours - makes it super easy to get your dev environment up and running on any new machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tcelestino/dotfiles.git
```

2. Set run file to install

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles && chmod +x install
```
3. Open `.zshrc` file and change variables "USER_NAME", "USER_EMAIL" and "NPM_SCOPE". You might set `GH_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` too.

```bash
4. Install

```bash
./install
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't forget set values `GH_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN`!!**

## Additional Configurations

- To set the keyboard layout to include the '√ß' character on Ubuntu, follow the steps in the article "[Ajeitando o cedilha errado (ƒá) no Ubuntu Linux](https://www.danielkossmann.com/pt/ajeitando-cedilha-errado-ubuntu-linux/)"
- Import the color scheme and other configurations into iTerm2. The settings can be found in the "iterm2" folder.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my configurations and make them more efficient and user-friendly. Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
