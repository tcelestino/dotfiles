# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles configuration repository. This project serves as a central hub for my personal configurations, settings, and customizations across various software applications and operating systems.

- **Version Control**: Fine-tuned Git settings for a seamless version control experience.
- **Window Managers**: Personalizations for window managers.
- **System Settings**: Tweaks and settings for the Linux or macOS system itself.
- **Development Tools**: Configuration for development tools.
